Prerequisites
-------------

26-bit build:
A RISC OS 3.1 (or later) system with C Release 3.1B (and selected bits of C Release 5).
RPCEmu Easy Start Bundle 3.71 is well suited to the task.
The application can run on RISC OS 2.0 (and later) systems with their ancient SharedCLibrary.

32-bit build:
A RISC OS 5 system with ROOL DDE Release 30c or later (C compiler, headers, libraries, linker, !Amu).
The application can run on RISC OS 3.1 (and later) systems with a suitably modern SharedCLibrary.


Zip (install with PackMan) for creating a zip of the final build.


First-time configuration and build
----------------------------------

Ensure that the system has 'seen' AcornC/C++ and set that environment.

Run the appropriate !SetEnvXX to set up the PipeDream 3 build environment.

If you are building a 26-bit version, !SetEnv26 will prompt you to put
copies of various C headers and tools that are needed into Library26.

Run !Amu.

In CWimp.r32, double-click '__Clean' and then drag 'Makefile' to !Amu.

In pd.r32, double-click '__Clean' and then drag 'Makefile' to !Amu.

This variant builds !PipeDrea3, renamed to avoid interfering with any PipeDream 4 that may be installed.


Subsequent builds
-----------------

After any reboot, you will need to:

Ensure that the system has 'seen' AcornC/C++ and set that environment.

Run the appropriate !SetEnvXX to set up the PipeDream 3 build environment.

Run !Amu.

In pd.r32, drag 'Makefile' to !Amu.

It's unlikely you'll want to change anything in CWimp!


Creating a package for distribution
----------------------------------- 

Make sure you've got the version number consistent! See version.c for notes.

Execute the Obey file r32.MakeRiscPkg.

This will copy only those files needed for distribution to PipeDream3_3_xx_yy
in $.Temp and create the corresponding distributable ZIP package file.
