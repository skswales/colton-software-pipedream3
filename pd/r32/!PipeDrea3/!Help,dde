%C%%H2%PipeDream 3 Help file

 
This file gives a summary of the mouse operations available in 
PipeDream 3.  It also gives a list of the expression operators and 
spreadsheet functions.  It is intended as a reminder rather than an 
exhaustive reference.  For more information refer to the PipeDream 3 
User Guide.

%C%%H2%Mouse operations

Many of these mouse operations are described interactively in the RISC 
OS !Help application when used in conjunction with PipeDream 3.

%H2%Opening a Pipedream window

To open a new PipeDream window, click Select on the PipeDrea3 icon on 
the icon bar.

%H2%Bringing up menus and choosing commands

With the pointer in a PipeDream window, click Menu to bring up the top 
level menu.

To bring up a sub-menu, drag the pointer over the arrow to the right of 
the menu name.

To choose a command, click Select on the command name.  this carries 
out the command and removes the menu from the screen.  If you click 
Adjust, the menu remains on the screen.


%H2%Loading documents

To load a PipeDream document, either double-click on its icon, or drag 
its icon onto the Pipedream icon on the icon bar.

To insert a file at the caret position, drag the file's icon into the 
window.


%H2%Positioning the caret

Click Select to position the caret in the first slot to the left which 
can overlap the slot underneath the pointer.  

Click Adjust to position the caret in the slot underneath the pointer.


%H2%Marking blocks

To mark a block within one column, drag select down the column.

To mark multiple columns of text, drag Adjust across them.

To mark all the rows in a range of columns, drag Select across the 
column borders.

To mark all the columns in a range of rows, drag Select down the row 
borders.

To mark all the columns in a single row, double-click Select in the row 
border.

To mark all the rows in a column, double-click Select in the column 
border.

To mark a single slot, double-click Select in the slot.

To mark the whole document, double-click Select in the top left-hand 
corner of the border.

To clear any marked block, double-click Adjust in the top left-hand 
corner of the border.

To adjust a marked block after marking it, move the pointer to the 
point at which you now want the block to end and hold down Shift whilst 
clicking Select.  The marked block will now end where you clicked 
Select.  The starting point will remain the same.

%H2%Entering slot references into the editing line

To enter a slot reference into the editing line whilst you are editing 
an expression, click Select or Adjust in the slot.  The slot can be in 
the current window or in another, in which case you will insert an 
external reference.

%H2%Scrolling the window

Position the pointer on the scroll arrow and click Select to scroll one 
line in the direction of the arrow.  Hold down Select to continue 
scrolling.  Click Adjust to scroll in the other direction.  The caret 
always remains within the PipeDream window, staying as near as possible 
to its original position.

Position the pointer on the darker part of the scroll bar (above the 
slider to scroll up, below the slider to scroll down) and click Select.  
The next windowful of the document will appear.  Click Adjust to scroll 
back the other way.  The caret always remains within the PipeDream 
window, moving, if necessary, to the point nearest to its position 
before scrolling.
