%H2%General

This file provides additional information to that in the PipeDream 3 User Guide.  Topics 
covered are:

















%H2%1. Acorn licence

The program !Chars and the modules Clib (the Shared C Library) and FPEmulator are owned 
by and have been provided by Acorn Computers Ltd for your use with PipeDream 3.  We 
would remind you that their use is subject to the conditions of the standard Acorn End User 
Licence Agreement as well as the conditions of the PipeDream licence agreement.  Copies of 
this are provided with the Archimedes computer and RISC OS or can be obtained directly 
from Acorn.

We would like to thank Acorn for its help and cooperation in providing these materials for 
your use.


%H2%2. Fonts

The PipeDream 3 User Guide implies that specifying fonts within your text only has effect on 
the printer and has no effect on the screen.  This is not the case.  Fonts are also displayed on 
the screen. 

To be able to display or print characters in fonts other than the system font (the system font is 
the one used in the title bar of every window) the Archimedes needs to have information 
about the shapes of all the letters.  This information is supplied on disc and is read from disc 
when needed.  The directory !Fonts on Applications Disc 1 contains some fonts and others 
may become available from Acorn or other sources.  

To speed up the operation of drawing fonts, RISC OS reduces the number of disc accesses by 
keeping as much font information in memory as it can.  The area of memory used for storing 
fonts is called the font cache and you can vary the amount of memory available for the font 
cache in the Task display accessible from the Archimedes 'A' icon bar menu.  The memory 
that you allocate to the font cache becomes unavailable to the rest of the system so it is best to 
keep it small.  However, if you find that fonts take ages to display because they are 
continually being read from disk you will need to give the font cache a little more memory.

In order to show RISC OS where to find the directory !Fonts it is necessary to catalogue the 
disc or directory which contains it.  Then, whenever RISC OS needs to read more font 
information, it will automatically read it from that disc.

The file Readme_f in this directory contains a copy of this document formatted in the font 
Trinity.Medium. Try loading that file into a window to compare the text with that in the 
system font.  If you have a dot matrix or laser printer and a suitable RISC OS printer driver, 
you can try printing Readme_f .  You may find that to obtain a reasonable speed in the display 
of fonts you need to allocate a lot of memory to the font cache and that to print at a reasonable 
speed on a dot matrix printer you need to allocate a lot of memory to the Module area. 
Printing with RISC OS drivers works best when using version 1.12, or later, of the RISC OS 
printer drivers which should be available from your Acorn dealer.  These drivers do not 
require you to allocate memory to the Module area before printing; they will use whatever 
memory is free in the computer.


%H2%3. Graphics

Pictures (in the form of !Draw files) and images (in the form of sprites) can be included in 
PipeDream documents and displayed on the screen and printed.  To include a picture, position 
the caret in a blank slot at the top-left of where you would like the picture and then drag the 
picture file from the disc directory into the PipeDream window.  The picture should then be 
drawn in the window.

Once inside the PipeDream window the picture can be rescaled.  The picture is represented in 
the PipeDream document as a filename, like this

@@ G:filename@

(Note that you should use only a single @@ at the start, a double @@ is used in the above slot to 
display the filename.) 

To rescale the picture insert the scale factor after the filename like this

@@ G:filename,70@

This would rescale the picture to 70%PC% of its original size.  To delete the picture, move the 
caret onto the slot containing the reference and delete the reference.  To move the picture, 
delete the reference and paste it into another slot.


%H2%5. Highlights in headers and footers

Highlights can be inserted into headers and footers (and the title) by inserting ^n where n is the 
highlight number (similar to search and replace).  For example ^4 would switch on italics.


%H2%6. Loading multi-file documents

The description given on page 211 of the PipeDream 3 User Guide on loading multi-file 
documents is incorrect.  Sorry!

To load a multi-file document drag the list file's icon to the PipeDream icon on the icon bar.  
This loads the first file of the multi-file document into a window. 

To load the list file itself for editing click Select on the PipeDream icon on the icon bar to 
open a new empty window and then drag the list file's icon into the new empty window.


%H2%7. Macro files

The sample macro file given on page 325 of the PipeDream 3 User Guide is incorrect.  It 
should read

 @F:Corpus.Medium@\Cdk|i 35 |i "¢" |m                         
 @F:Corpus.Medium@\Cdf|i "F1" |i "\R|m" |m                    
 @F:Corpus.Medium@\Cdf|i "Shift F2" |i "\CGS |i C3 |m" |m     
 @F:Corpus.Medium@\Cdf|i "Ctrl F3" |i "\Q|m\Z|m" |m           
 @F:Corpus.Medium@\Cdf|i "Ctrl-Shift F1" |i "\FH|m" |m        

Note the different way in which the function keys are specified.  It is always easiest to 
generate macro files using the Record Macro File command (Ctrl-FY) which is on the long 
cursor menu.  Also if you need to know the syntax of macro files precisely, use the macro 
recorder and then load the resulting macro file by dragging it to the PipeDream icon on the 
icon bar.


%H2%8. Printing formulae

If you want to print your spreadsheet with the formulae showing rather than the resulting 
values first convert the slots from numeric slots to textual slots by using the Number <> Text 
command (Ctrl-ENT) which is available on the long Blocks menu.  After printing you will 
probably want to convert back to numeric slots by using Ctrl-ENT again.


%H2%9. Z88 Filing System

The Z88 Filing System provided on the PipeDream 3 disc enables you to connect a Z88 
computer to the Archimedes and load files from it and save files to it as if it were a disc drive.  
In order to do this two extra pieces of hardware are required - a Z88-Archimedes lead and the 
PC-LINK EPROM card plugged into the Z88.  Both of these components are available 
separately from Colton Software.

To use the Z88 filing system, double-click Select on the Z88 icon on the PipeDream 3 disc.  
The Z88 Filing System will load and install its icon on the icon bar.  Ensure that the lead is 
connected securely to both computers and that the PC-LINK EPROM card is inserted and 
running in the Z88. Now click Select on the Z88 icon on the icon bar.  A directory viewer 
should appear showing the devices available on the Z88.  Click Select on one of the devices 
and a directory viewer will appear showing the files and directories currently in the device.  

If you receive the message "Failed to synchronise with the Z88 (Is PC-LINK running on the 
Z88?)" check that the lead is connected securely in both computers, and that the PC-LINK 
EPROM is correctly inserted and running in the Z88.  (To start PC-LINK press []L (square L) 
on the Z88.)

With the Z88 Filing System running you can copy files between a directory on an Archimedes 
disk and a directory in the Z88.  You can create selections in directories on both the Z88 and 
Archimedes and copy the selections.  You can also copy files from the Z88 to PipeDream 3 
running on the Archimedes either by dragging the file to the PipeDream 3 icon on the icon bar 
to load the file, or by dragging the file into a PipeDream window to insert it into another 
document.  Similarly you can save a file from PipeDream 3 to the Z88 by dragging the file 
icon from the Save dialog box to the Z88 directory viewer.

You can also drag files from the Z88 to other, but not all, applications.  For example you can 
load files from the Z88 straight into Edit by dragging files in a similar way to that described 
above for PipeDream 3.  Some applications will not be able to load or save Z88 files directly 
and the data will be corrupted when it is displayed in the application's window.  Of course, 
you can copy the file into a directory on an Archimedes disc first, and then load it into the 
application.  (For the technically minded, this is because the PC-LINK EPROM does not 
support random access, just sequential access.)

Not all of the filing system operations are supported by the Z88 Filing System.  You cannot 
use the Access, Delete or Rename commands on the Filer Selection sub-menu to operate on 
Z88 files.  Neither can you create directories on the Z88 from the Archimedes; you must do 
this on the Z88 itself, using its own Filing System.


%H2%10. Printer Drivers

Three PipeDream printer drivers are provided.  These are %H2%fx80%H2% for Epson compatible dot 
matrix printers, %H2%juki%H2% for daisywheel printers, and %H2%HPjet%H2% for Hewlett-Packard Laserjet and 
compatible printers.  They are in directory !PipeDrea3 (which you can open by pressing Shift 
whilst double-clicking on !PipeDrea3).

These drivers are for PipeDream type printing only.  For RISC OS type printing use the 
appropriate driver available from the Application disc or RISC OS Extras disc.


%L%%H2%11. Printing with RISC OS printer drivers from 1Mbyte computers

A number of people have asked how to print using the "fancy fonts" and the RISC OS printer 
drivers on dot matrix printers from an Archimedes having only 1Mbyte of memory.  

The general problem is that optimal use of RISC OS requires more than 1Mbyte of RAM.  
This is true not just for usage of PipeDream but also true for usage of most other Archimedes 
applications.  1Mbyte is generally sufficient for a single application to run but expectations 
constantly rise about fonts, screen and printer resolutions and document sizes, and it is also 
desirable to have several applications running together now that applications are starting to 
communicate between themselves intelligently.  Currently 2Mbytes is fine for most users, 
enabling several applications to be run concurrently, with many documents loaded, and 
generous caches for fonts and printer drivers and so on.  Given past trends it may be expected 
that some time in the future 2Mbytes will seem cramped and 4Mbytes or even more will 
become the norm.  Decisions about upgrading are subjective and depend upon need and 
finance but, at present, much more can be done in 2Mbytes than 1Mbyte.  After loading 
PipeDream 3 you can expect 250K free on a 1Mbyte computer or 1,250K free on a 2Mbyte 
computer.  Note that memory for a font cache and a RISC OS printer driver has to be 
allocated from this area.  Remember that using the system font on screen and PipeDream 
printer drivers  to print does not require any font cache or extra memory for a printer driver.

We recommend you use PrinterDM 1.12, or later, which is available on the RISC OS Extras 
Disc and FontManager 2.42, or later, together with the outline fonts which are available on the 
Acorn Fonts disc or from Acorn Desktop Publisher.  All of these should be available from 
your Acorn dealer.

The key to printing with RISC OS drivers is to have memory free for the driver to use as a 
buffer.  The more memory the faster the print.

A reasonable configuration for your computer is as follows.  Perform





and then do a Ctrl-Reset.  Your memory allocation in the task display should now be  
approximately:







Next, catalogue the disc containing !Fonts and then load PipeDream onto the icon bar.  
Version 3.07 of PipeDream requires 432K and there should now be about 160K free.  Load 
PrinterDM onto the icon bar, select the appropriate printer type and then select Quit on 
PrinterDM's menu.  There should now be about 128K free.  Load/create your document and 
print.

Extra memory can be recovered by unplugging the Percussion, Stringlib, Wavesynth,  
SoundChannels and SoundDMA modules which yields about 24K.  Printing in modes 0 or 1 
will free a further 56K for the driver buffer.  Printing sprites is best done in mode 1.


%H2%12. New features in PipeDream 3.07

%H1%Print scaling%H1%  A new option in the print dialog box enables you to specify the size of print to 
be used.  Note that this only works with the RISC OS printer drivers.

%H1%Grid printing%H1%  The grid can now be printed.  The print is not quite as slick as the screen 
display as vertical lines are drawn through overlapping text.  However printing numerical 
documents with the grid can make a vast difference to the presentation.

%H1%Editing in fonts%H1%  If you have a printer font selected the current line is also now displayed on 
the screen in that font.  If you find that your monitor is not of a sufficiently high resolution for 
the editing to be readable use the system font for editing and switch to your favoured font 
before printing.

%H1%Caret colour%H1%  The colour of the caret can now be changed in the colours dialog box.

%H1%Saving%H1%  Clicking Select on Save in the Files menu will now cause PipeDream to save the file 
without prompting with a dialog box if it can.  If the filename is ambiguous (ie there is no 
directory path) PipeDream will put up a dialog box in the usual way.  This is a feature of 
RISC OS and gives you the option of repeated saving with or without changing the filename 
and with a minimum of mouse operations.  (On other systems these are known as "Save..." 
and "Save as...".

%H1%Define command  (Ctrl CDC)%H1%

Define Command enables you to redefine the Ctrl key sequences.  For example if you wanted 
Ctrl-C to perform a Copy Block command you would specify

 Command to define:  C
 Define as:          BC

Think carefully before redefining the Ctrl sequences in this way.  Remember that PipeDream 
uses the letters F E L P B C and S as the first character of multiple commands and so if you 
redefine any of these you will be affecting a lot of commands.


%H2%13. New features in PipeDream 3.10

%H1%Border colour%H1%  The current row and column borders can be drawn in a different colour to help 
the eye find the current slot more easily.  This colour can be set in the colours dialog box.

%H1%Overlaying pictures%H1%  Graphics files in Draw format can now be overlaid by text in PipeDream.  
An example of this is Whatif which is provided in the examples.  In this example boxes have 
been created in !Draw and these are used to highlight slots in PipeDream.  This feature is very 
good for creating form templates.

%H1%Slot references%H1%  Slot references can now be put into header and footer fields.  (Highlights can 
also be used in headers, footers, searching and leading and trailing character fields; use ^1 to 
^8 to specify highlight 1 to highlight 8.) 

%H2%14. New features in PipeDream 3.12

%H1%International Spelling Checker%H1% The spelling checker can now cope with characters other than 
A-Z, hyphen and apostrophe.  The list of characters, sorting sequences and endings is given in 
a file in !PipeDrea3.Dictdefn.  There is one file for each type of dictionary.  We recommend 
that you do not try to modify these files and support may not be given for problems that occur 
if you do.

When creating a user dictionary there is a new option in the Create User Dictionary dialog 
box for you to specify a type of dictionary.  This is taken from the files in Dictdefn.  Normally 
you would just leave it set to English.

A new command (User Dictionary Options - Ctrl-SQ) has been added to enable you to make 
user dictionaries read-only.  This prevents you adding new words to the dictionary.  It is of 
most use to Econet users who can now have read-only user dictionaries accessable by multiple 
users.

%H1%DTP Export

A new DTP Export has been written and can be accessed from the Save dialog box.  The old 
DTP Export has been renamed as FWP export.  The new exporter exports paragraphs and 
tabular data more appropriately for Acorn DTP than before as Acorn DTP does not cope very 
well with paragraphs and tabular data in First Word Plus files.

%H2%15. Known problem with printing

PipeDream is unable to correctly print multi-file documents with many RISC OS printer 
drivers.  PrinterPS works okay, as do the newer versions (1.12 upwards) of PrinterDM and LJ 
if enough memory is available for a full page buffer.
