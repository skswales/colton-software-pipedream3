Dear Mr. Pontings,

%C%%H2%Overdraft facilities

Thank you for your letter of January 8th. I must apologise for allowing 
our overdraft to exceed the agreed limit without first informing you of 
the situation.

As I explained before, we have had to repair extensive damage to the 
house caused by the storms of last October, a large part of which we 
were unable to claim on our domestic insurance policy. However, I can 
assure you that the work is now nearly finished and that our account 
will
