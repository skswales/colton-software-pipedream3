# File of internal messages for RISC_OSlib. Default messages are in English
# so you only need this file if you wish to change such messages to another
# language (in which case use msgs_init()).
# Some messages (txt44-txt47, txt64-txt68) are used by !Edit and are not
# provided by the library; hence these are commented out here.
